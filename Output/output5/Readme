format:
user:movie score

e.g.
101:108	0.03
101:112	0.08
...
meaning:
After matrix multiplication and ruling out the movies that user 101 has already watched, we see that for user 101 movie 108 has score 0.03, and movie 112 0.08.
We will have more for user 101. Here we just list two for convenience. (For the score, the greater, the better we want to recommend it to that user)
